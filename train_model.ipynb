Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes. Not for the faint-hearted \\u0096 just the thick-headed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n

     \"beat a path to this important documentary that looks like an attractive feature forbidden lie 2007 is simply a better cinematic version of norma khouri s book forbidden love and that was a best seller an onion peeling of literary fraud and of a pretty woman lie is the very best in editorialised reality tv br br cleverly edited and colourful broinowski s storytelling is chaptered by moving silhouettes of norma khouri meaningfully blowing smoke i disagree with variety that it s overlong instead my one slight problem was with the episodic nature of its key players commenting on others just recorded testimonials on a single watching your sense of narrative becomes mired so i watched it twice br br this oscar worthy effort is at once genuinely funny upsetting and totally engrossing as it documents one lie after another the apparent con unfolded in the australian state of queensland via very personal swindles of khouri s friends and fans clearly these friends are now turned the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri s qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat no nonsense colloquialisms i think it s a load of sh t personally br br we need to learn from their experience hence my belief in spoilers any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie br br there s some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration br br since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication khouri has been on the run but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name she absconded supposedly because a she s either terrified of her sly more italian sounding than greek husband or b because she needed her passport visas to clear her name br br unlikely br br a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no not jordan according to a closing card khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 br br i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge instead the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen once they caught on there was plenty counter derision and catcalls earlier stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn t know how to take khouri s evolving contradictions br br the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice br br anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35yr old with rather disarming charm and surprisingly worked out biceps br br gradually we re introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri s honour killing accusations hook line and sinker later we see their more rueful reactions quite self controlled and matter of fact if some perhaps a little bitter br br it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri s fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change honour killings do happen in jordan it s just their prevalence that s at odds with khouri s book plus 72 other facts in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections br br the publishing houses across 4 continents who d jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract they too were fair game so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes br br later still we re shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri s bio as well for one thing she s not only not a 35yr old virgin her defence is that she merely didn t disabuse people of their assumptions but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers sometimes she s just too fast talking in her american accent she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don t need any western paternalism from me but when even cultural cues don t jibe in addition to khouri s facts you ve got to start questioning your source br br at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account in person in jordan the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman where one fact after another falls eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story and it s after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera secret because in it khouri s american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he s an actor we never find out how anna uncovered it br br so this becomes the filmmaker s triumph as she never flags in her tone or commitment her on camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt fbi documents and khouri s most shocking initial crime br br anna broinowski watch list her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players cross commenting on footage to kill two birds making her audiences want to drink from the same well again br br in fact despite her deceptively demure approach she made me re confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri
